# Multi-turn prompt

This bot has been created to show how to use the prompts classes included in `agents-bot-hosting`.  This bot will ask for the user's name and age, then store the responses. It demonstrates a multi-turn dialog flow using a text prompt, a number prompt, and state accessors to store and retrieve values.
